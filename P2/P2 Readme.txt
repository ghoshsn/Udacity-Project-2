"You'll demonstrate your mastery of the language's syntax through a series of challenges. Each multipart problem mimics a real-life challenge that front-end developers face. You'll be required to write clean code and to apply your knowledge of variables, objects, JSON, functions and control flow to successfully solve the challenges."
